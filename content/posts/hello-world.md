First post using a new set of tools:

- [Hermit](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit): for managing necessary dependencies and tools for this project, like `hugo` and Golang
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): static site generator using the [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) theme
- [Giscus](https://giscus.app/): a cool comment functionality using GitHub discussions as a backend
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions): for deploying to GitHub pages
- [Pre-Commit](https://pre-commit.com/): formatting, automating spell check, etc.

The goal will be to make short posts as a simple archive of learnings, good tools, etc.
